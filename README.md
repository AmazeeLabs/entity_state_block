# Entity state block

Provides some useful information about entity state on the entity view page.

For example, on the content (node) page it can show:

* published/unpublished status,
* authored by,
* last edited by,
* assigned domains,
* translations information,
* etc.

Implemented as a block, so it could be used via the standard block system, or panels/panelizer.
